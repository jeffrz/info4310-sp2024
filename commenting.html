    <h4>INFO4310 Discussion Commenting</h4>
    <p>
      Each week, paper presenters will be posting a thread to <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/54688/discussion/">Ed Discussion</a> for their reading. <strong>Every student must comment on each reading (except any they are presenting)</strong> by Tuesday at midnight. Comments should be substantial (i.e., at least a paragraph) and raise something interesting you found about the article, constructive criticism, related work, etc. You are welcome to either discuss a new topic within the article's post or reply to a classmate and continue the conversation thread. These pre-class comments will be used by the discussion leaders to guide discussion. Discussion leaders: be sure to read your classmates' comments before class. Late comments will not be counted for credit. Partial credit will not be awarded.
